# kean stuff
I post my notes/materials here for my duration of college. I intend to use this for my 4 years of attending college for my B.S. in Computer Science and Cybersecurity.

Materials, textbooks, syllabuses, etc. will be freely posted here. Files will be organized to the order they come in my schedule.

Currently, I still need to plan my degree path and what credits to take, so much of the stuff here are just placeholders for what is to come.
